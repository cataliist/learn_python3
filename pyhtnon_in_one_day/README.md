Welcome to CATAL[ii]ST
----------------------

python_in_one_day: An effort to document basics of python for future reference (for beginners & expereienced geeks and ourself as well)
-----------------
This documentation is based on python3 (which resembles >90% syntax with python2.x). This documentation assumes you are working on linux and familier with CLI and also know basic shell commands. Most of the linux distributions come with python interpreter installed.  

To check the version of python iterpreter:
-----------------------------------------
 $ python3 -V 
Python 3.6.9

(in command python3 -V, V is in caps; small v will take you to the IDLE shell which starts with ">>>")
Note: "$" will resemble your shell prompt here and after


Comments in python:
-------------------
# =>            For single line comment
''' or """ =>   For multi line comments

For e.g. 
#This is single line comment

'''
This is
multiline
comment
'''

"""
This is
multiline
comment
too
"""


Variable and assigning values to them:
-------------------------------------
myName = 'cataliister'
myTeam = 70

Explaination:
myName => is a variable (nomenclature can include letters(a-z A-Z), number and underscore(_))
"=" => This sign assign whatever at the right of it to the variable
cataliister => string (can be single or double quoated)

myTeam => is also a variable with integer assigned so it is integer variable

There are several other variables according to the datatype they store (will come to them later in this documentation)


FROM THIS POINT WE WILL NOT EXPLAIN THE THINGS BUT SHOW YOU BY CREATING INDIVIDUAL FILES (python scripts with extention .py)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can open the scripts in your text editor to read or run using below command in the terminal:

$ python3 playWithPython.py


playWithStrings.py
